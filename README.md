# 100_days_of_swift
This project is meant to follow along with Paul Hudson’s 100 Days of Swift challenge. There are many 100 Days of Swift challenges out there in the wild, but Paul is one of the best contributors to education that the Swift community has, and when I saw him throw down the gauntlet, I couldn’t resist taking part.
